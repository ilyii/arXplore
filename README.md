## Introduction

The exponential growth of scientific literature has made it increasingly difficult for researchers to find relevant papers using traditional search methods. arXplore aims to address this challenge by providing an advanced, user-friendly search tool that leverages semantic analysis to uncover papers with similar content and themes, going beyond mere keyword matching. By enhancing the discovery of semantically similar papers, arXplore seeks to streamline the research process, making it more efficient and effective.


## Data
The data used in this project is sourced from [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/), a free distribution service and an open-access archive for scholarly articles in mostly physics, mathematics and computer science, but also other fields such as quantitative biology, finance, or statistics. 

The dataset contains metadata for over 1.7 million papers, including valuable information such as the title, abstract, authors and category of each paper. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv).
